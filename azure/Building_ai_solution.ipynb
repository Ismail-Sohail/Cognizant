    "Model Selection: The Microsoft Sentiment Analysis model was chosen for its task alignment and strong performance in text sentiment prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Management Process: The model was labeled, versioned, and organized in Azure AI Studio for efficient tracking and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution Development: We integrated the model with Azure's Text Analytics API, preprocessing the data and evaluating model performance.\n",
